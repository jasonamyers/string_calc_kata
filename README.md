### String Calculator Kata

This example of the string calculator kata from
[Roy Osherove](http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1/) was written using
nose style unit tests and nosy to watch for file changes.  To reduce reliance on
the detailed output, rednose is used to colorize the success failure output.

You can run the tests after the fact by runing nosetests, or to go into watch
for file changes mode run nosy.

The setup.cfg file is the configuration nosy uses to decide where to watch for
changes and what tests to run.

I was using iTerm and a three pane setup as seen [here](http://d.pr/i/Puaz).
